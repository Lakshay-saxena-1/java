This is my first Github Repository.
I have made a Tic Tac Toe game.
The file sturcture is of form -
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
The code for the game is inside the src folder conataing the game code inside App.java
Play and have fun.
